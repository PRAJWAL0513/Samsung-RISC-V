## üõ†Ô∏è Task 1: RISC-V ISA and GNU Toolchain

### Overview

This task provides an introduction to the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and walks through the setup of the development environment using the **VSDSquadron RISC-V board**. Participants will gain hands-on experience with running C programs, cross-compiling for RISC-V, and analyzing the generated assembly and memory architecture.

### üîß Implementation Steps

#### 1. Running a C Program in Ubuntu

Set up your environment to execute a C program. Follow the command flow and configuration instructions as depicted in the figure below.

#### 2. C Program for Summing `n` Integers

Develop a simple C program to calculate the sum of `n` integers. The figure below illustrates the cross-compilation workflow for executing this program on a RISC-V processor.

#### 3. Examining Generated RISC-V Assembly Code

Analyze the assembly code generated during cross-compilation. This step helps in understanding the mapping of high-level C constructs to RISC-V assembly instructions.

#### 4. Memory Architecture Analysis (Main Function)

Study the memory layout of the `main` function, including stack, heap, and other memory sections. The figure below highlights the memory mapping details for a RISC-V program.
